  "description": "Functionality in this library is largely implemented using an abstraction called a 'slice'. A slice represents a part of a string - anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.",
